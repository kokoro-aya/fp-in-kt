Contains some template codes from book and my solutions for exercises of the book *The Joy of Kotlin*

Warning: I haven't verified my solution per tests, so they might contain numerous bugs, although they should be 
syntactically correct. Anyway they aren't meant to be used in productive environment.

I have done exercises until binary tree. Some code of binary tree were my solution but from this chapter till the
end of the book most of the code aren't my solution.

There are only listings but no exercise in chap 13 and 14.

I have renamed the List to IList and MList, meaning for Immutable List and Memoized Immutable List, this might not be 
a good decision.
